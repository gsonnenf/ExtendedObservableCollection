# ExtendedObservableCollection
 This library contains a set of tools for making your Lists, Dictionaries and other Collections observable. Theses libraries can be instantiated on their own, or can wrap standard collections. This library also includes utility classes including a synchronization observable collection which can synchronize an observable list of viewmodels to a source list of models.
